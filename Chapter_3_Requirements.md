# EduConnect Chapter 3 Requirements - System Analysis

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Software Design Methodology

### Design Methodology

**Approach**: **Component-Based Design with MVC/MVP Architecture**

- Followed a **modular, component-based design** using Flutter's widget-centric architecture
- Implemented **Provider pattern for state management** (not Riverpod as initially mentioned)
- Used **Repository pattern** with service layers for data management
- Applied **Clean Architecture principles** with separation of concerns:
  - Models (Data entities)
  - Services (Business logic & API calls)
  - Providers (State management)
  - Screens (UI/Presentation)
  - Widgets (Reusable UI components)

### Design Philosophy

**Primary**: **User-first, role-based design**

- **Role-based access control** - Clear separation between student and lecturer experiences
- **Offline-first approach** - Works without internet connectivity using local caching
- **Mobile-first responsive design** - Optimized for mobile devices
- **Security-first** - Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented throughout

### Tools Used

- **Supabase Dashboard** - Database design and management
- **Flutter's built-in tools** - No external prototyping tools mentioned in codebase
- **Git version control** - Standard development workflow

- created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**Classes**

```sql
- id (UUID, PK)
- name (TEXT)

- course_code (TEXT)
- level (TEXT)
- start_date, end_date (TIMESTAMP)
- created_by (UUID, FK to auth.users)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**Class_Members (Pivot Table)**

```sql
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (UUID, FK to auth.users)
- class_id (UUID, FK to classes)
- joined_at (TIMESTAMP)
- UNIQUE(user_id, class_id)
```

**Assignments**

```sql
- id (UUID, PK)

- **Navigation Flow Charts** - App screen flows

### UI Documentation:

- Use **screenshots from the actual app** for UI examples
- Include **wireframes for key user journeys**
- Add **component hierarchy diagrams** for Flutter widget structure

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. User Interaction Flow

### Student Journey - Joining a Class:

1. Student logs in â†’ Dashboard
2. Selects "Join Class" option
3. Enters unique class code
4. System validates code and adds student to class
5. Student receives SMS confirmation (if enabled)
6. Class appears in student's dashboard

### Lecturer Journey - Creating a Class:

1. Lecturer logs in â†’ Dashboard
2. Selects "Create Class" option
3. Fills class details (name, course code, level, dates)
4. System generates unique class code
5. Class is created and appears in lecturer's dashboard
6. Lecturer can share class code with students

### SMS Notification Flow:

1. Lecturer posts announcement
2. System identifies class members
3. SMS sent via mNotify service to all students
4. Delivery status tracked and logged

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Status Summary

| Component             | Status      | Notes                          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Authentication**    | âœ… Complete | Role-based with profile images |
| **Class Management**  | âœ… Complete | Full CRUD with RLS             |
| **Announcements**     | âœ… Complete | Real-time updates              |
| **Resources**         | âœ… Complete | File upload/download           |
| **Assignments**       | âœ… Complete | With submission system         |
| **SMS Notifications** | âœ… Complete | mNotify integration            |
| **Offline Support**   | âœ… Complete | Multi-layer caching            |

### Technical Debt:

- Some provider files appear empty (resource_provider.dart)
- Large files indicate potential refactoring opportunities
- Missing comprehensive error logging system

This architecture demonstrates a well-structured, scalable educational platform with strong security foundations and offline capabilities.
