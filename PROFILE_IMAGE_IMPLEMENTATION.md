# Profile Image Upload Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of profile image upload functionality in the EduConnect app.

## Overview

The profile image feature allows users to upload, update, and remove their profile pictures. Images are stored in Supabase Storage and the URLs are saved in the database.

## Database Changes

### 1. Add Profile Image Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN profile_image_url TEXT;
```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

Run the complete migration script in `database_migration.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

## Components Modified

### 1. User Models (`lib/models/user_model.dart`)

- Added `profileImageUrl` property to the base `User` class
- Updated `Student` and `Lecturer` classes to include profile image support
- Modified `fromJson()` and `toJson()` methods

### 2. Supabase Service (`lib/services/supabase_service.dart`)

- Added `uploadProfileImage()` method for uploading images to storage
- Added `deleteProfileImage()` method for cleaning up old images
- Updated `updateStudentProfile()` and `updateLecturerProfile()` methods

### 3. Auth Provider (`lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`)

- Updated profile update methods to handle image files
- Added `File?` parameter to update methods

### 4. Edit Profile Screen (`lib/screens/profile/edit_profile_screen.dart`)

- Added image picker functionality
- Implemented image preview and removal
- Added camera icon with popup menu for image operations

### 5. Profile Tab (`lib/screens/dashboard/profile_tab.dart`)

- Updated to display actual profile images instead of just initials
- Added fallback to initials if image fails to load
- Implemented loading states for network images

## Storage Structure

Images are stored in the `profile-images` bucket with the following structure:

```
profile-images/
  public/
    profile_{user_id}_{uuid}.{extension}
```

## Security Policies

The implementation includes comprehensive RLS (Row Level Security) policies:

1. **Upload Policy**: Users can only upload images to their own folder
2. **Read Policy**: All profile images are publicly readable
3. **Update Policy**: Users can only update their own images
4. **Delete Policy**: Users can only delete their own images

## Features

### Image Upload

- Support for common image formats (JPEG, PNG)
- Automatic image compression (512x512 max, 80% quality)
- Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts

### Image Management

- Automatic cleanup of old images when uploading new ones
- Graceful fallback to user initials if image fails to load
- Loading indicators during image upload and display

### User Experience

- Intuitive camera icon for image operations
- Popup menu with options to choose from gallery or remove photo
- Real-time preview of selected images
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. Go to Profile → Edit Profile
2. Tap the camera icon on the profile picture
3. Select "Choose from Gallery" to upload a new image
4. Select "Remove Photo" to delete the current image
5. Save changes to apply the new profile image

### For Developers

1. Run the database migration script in Supabase
2. Ensure the `image_picker` dependency is included in `pubspec.yaml`
3. Test the functionality on both platforms (iOS/Android)

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- Network connectivity issues
- Image picker failures
- Upload failures with automatic cleanup
- Image loading failures with fallback

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Compression**: Images are automatically resized and compressed
2. **Caching**: Network images are cached by the Flutter framework
3. **Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of old images prevents storage bloat
4. **Indexing**: Database index on `profile_image_url` for better query performance

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload image from gallery
- [ ] Remove existing profile image
- [ ] View profile image in profile tab
- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully
- [ ] Verify old images are cleaned up
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Verify storage policies work correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not uploading**: Check Supabase storage bucket permissions
2. **Images not displaying**: Verify the bucket is set to public
3. **Permission denied**: Ensure RLS policies are correctly configured
4. **Large file sizes**: Images are automatically compressed to 512x512

### Debug Steps

1. Check Supabase dashboard for storage bucket creation
2. Verify RLS policies in the Storage section
3. Check browser/app console for detailed error messages
4. Test with small image files first

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- Avatar cropping functionality
- Multiple image sizes (thumbnails, full-size)
- Image filters or editing capabilities
- Bulk image operations for administrators
- Integration with external image services

## Dependencies

Required packages:

- `image_picker: ^1.0.7` (already included)
- `supabase_flutter: ^2.3.1` (already included)
